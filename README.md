# Music

My Music repo in git. Not exhaustive yet.

# Update

I switched to `mpv <args>` Instead of using `yt-dlp <args> | mpv <args>`

Then, I put most of the args inside MPV config files for streaming and Yt-dlp config files for download, so the usage becomes a simple `mpv (pbpaste)` i.e. a clipboard paste.

In the near future, I'll be updating my dotfiles linking and then, the dotfiles repo.

# Requirements 

yt-dlp (and ffplay)

# Usage

``` bash
source songs_shuffle.sh
shuffle
```
